MDMonsterNew

This is the upgraded monster firmware. It contains the Arpeggiator firmware,
the MDWesenLivePatch firmware, and the MDPitchEuclid firmware.

The first page shown is a clever firmware select page. Each encoder
corresponds to a firmware:
- first encoder: MDArpeggiator,
- second encoder: MDWesenLivePatch
- third encoder: MDPitchEuclid

Pressing the encoder selects the firmware, and it is usable as it
would be in normal mode. Holding down all 4 buttons returns to the
selection page (this key combination is just for testing, I will try
to come up with a better one).

The selection page allows for a number of additional feature.

Button1 (top left) + Encoder -> Mute On/Off
Arp -> mute arp
Euclid -> mute euclid

Button2 (bottom left) + Encoder -> Special Function
LivePatch -> Supatrigga
Euclid -> randomize

Button3 (bottom right) + Encoder-> Show Temporary Page 1
Arp -> Arp Page 1 (TRK SELECT etc...)
LivePatch -> Delay Page 1
Euclid -> Euclid Page 1

Button4 (bottom left) + Encoder -> Show Temporary Page 2
Arp -> Arp Page 2
LivePatch -> Breakdown
Euclid -> Euclid Page 2

----------------------------------------------------------

Configuration of sync and merging. Hold down Button1 (top
left) and then switch the MiniCommand ON. CLK selects the input port
(IN1 or IN2), SND activates sending out of the clock on the MIDI
Output, and MRG selects which messages on the second MIDI input will
be merged into the output stream (CC, NOTE or SYX
messages). MonoMachine Sysex messages won't be merged correctly (for
now).
